```bash
# Task 1: Shell Basics
echo $SHELL           # Check default shell
whoami                # Confirm logged-in user

# Task 2: Navigation and Files
pwd                   # Print current working directory
ls                    # List files
ls -l
ls -a
ls -lh

cd /tmp               # Move to temp directory
pwd
cd ~                  # Return to home

mkdir shells-lab      # Create new lab folder
cd shells-lab
touch info.txt        # Create a text file

echo "Hello Linux Shell" > info.txt
cat info.txt

grep "Linux" info.txt # Search for word in file
file info.txt         # Show file type
which grep            # Show location of command
history               # View command history
